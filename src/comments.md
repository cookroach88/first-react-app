.preparing
- create own readme and comment file
- copying project header and footer into
- install git and amke your first commits

.syntax
<!-- comment into html code (one-line/multi-line) -->
// one-line comment into js-code
{{text}} special comment in js/jsx-code
/* multi-line comment into js-code
*/
~ comments in json-files isn't possible
  (that's the reason it's better to extract all comments)

[2020-04-28]
extract some standard comments:
++/src/index.js++ (end of file)
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA

++/public/index.html++ (standard comment between the lines)
<!--
   manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
   user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
-->
<!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<!--
      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
